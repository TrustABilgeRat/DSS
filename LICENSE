 Gnu general public license
                       version 3, 29 june 2007

 copyright (c) 2007 free software foundation, inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 everyone be permitted to copy an' distribute verbatim copies
 o' this here license document, but changin' it be not allowed.
 
                            preamble

  the gnu general public license be a free, copyleft license fer
software an' other kinds o' works.
 
  the licenses fer most software an' other practical works be designed
to take away yer freedom to share an' change the works. By contrast,
the gnu general public license be intended to guarantee yer freedom to
share an' change all versions o' a program--to make sure it remains free
software fer all its users. We, the free software foundation, use the
gnu general public license fer most o' our software; it applies also to
any other work released this here way by its authors. Ye can apply it to
yer programs, too.
 
  when we speak o' free software, we be referrin' to freedom, not
price. Our general public licenses be designed to make sure that there ye
'ave the freedom to distribute copies o' free software (and charge fer
them if ye wish), that there ye receive source code or can get it if ye
want it, that there ye can change the software or use pieces o' it in new
free programs, an' that there ye know ye can do these things.
 
  to protect yer rights, we need to prevent others from denyin' ye
these rights or askin' ye to surrender the rights. Therefore, ye 'ave
certain responsibilities if ye distribute copies o' the software, or if
ye modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom o' others.
 
  fer example, if ye distribute copies o' such a program, whether
gratis or fer a fee, ye must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that there ye received. Ye must make sure that there they, too, receive
or can get the source code. An' ye must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
 
  developers that there use the gnu gpl protect yer rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, an' (2) offer ye this here license
givin' ye legal permission to copy, distribute an'/or modify it.
 
  fer the developers' an' authors' protection, the gpl clearly explains
that there there be no warranty fer this here free software. Fer both users' an'
authors' sake, the gpl requires that there modified versions be marked as
changed, so that there their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors o' previous versions.
 
  some devices be designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions o' the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This here be fundamentally incompatible with the aim o'
protectin' users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
pattern o' such abuse occurs in the area o' products fer individuals to
use, which be precisely where it be most unacceptable. Therefore, we
'ave designed this here version o' the gpl to prohibit the practice fer them
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this here provision to them domains in future versions
o' the gpl, as needed to protect the freedom o' users.
 
  finally, every program be threatened constantly by software patents.
 states should not allow patents to restrict development an' use o'
software on general-purpose computers, but in them that there do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that there patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this here, the gpl assures that there
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
 
  the precise terms an' conditions fer copying, distribution an'
modification follow.
 
                       terms an' conditions

  0. Definitions.
 
  "this license" refers to version 3 o' the gnu general public license.
 
  "copyright" also means copyright-like laws that there apply to other kinds o'
works, such as semiconductor masks.
 
  "the program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this here
license. Each licensee be addressed as "you". "licensees" an'
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 
  to "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part o' the work
in a fashion requirin' copyright permission, other than the makin' o' an
exact copy. The resultin' work be called a "modified version" o' the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 
  a "covered work" means either the unmodified program or a work based
on the program.
 
  to "propagate" a work means to do anythin' with it that there, without
permission, would make ye directly or secondarily liable fer
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executin' it on a
computer or modifyin' a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), makin' available to the
public, an' in some countries other activities as well.
 
  to "convey" a work means any kind o' propagation that there enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer o' a copy, be not conveyin'.
 
  an interactive user interface displays "appropriate legal notices"
to the extent that there it includes a convenient an' prominently visible
feature that there (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, an' (2)
tells the user that there there be no warranty fer the work (except to the
extent that there warranties be provided), that there licensees may convey the
work under this here license, an' 'ow to view a copy o' this here license. If
the interface presents a list o' user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this here criterion.
 
  1. Source code.
 
  the "source code" fer a work means the preferred form o' the work
fer makin' modifications to it. "object code" means any non-source
form o' a work.
 
  a "standard interface" means an interface that there either be an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case o'
interfaces specified fer a particularrr programmin' language, one that there
be widely used among developers workin' in that there language.
 
  the "system libraries" o' an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a 'ole, that there (a) be included in the normal form o'
packagin' a major component, but which be not part o' that there major
component, an' (b) serves only to enable use o' the work with that there
major component, or to implement a standard interface fer which an
implementation be available to the public in source code form. A
"major component", in this here context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, an' so on) o' the specific operatin' system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 
  the "correspondin' source" fer a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, an' (for an executable
work) run the object code an' to modify the work, includin' scripts to
control them activities. 'owever, it does not include the work's
system libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which be used unmodified in performin' them activities but
which ain't part o' the work. Fer example, correspondin' source
includes interface definition files associated with source files fer
the work, an' the source code fer shared libraries an' dynamically
linked subprograms that there the work be specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between them
subprograms an' other parts o' the work.
 
  the correspondin' source need not include anythin' that there users
can regenerate automatically from other parts o' the correspondin'
source.
 
  the correspondin' source fer a work in source code form be that there
same work.
 
  2. Basic permissions.
 
  all rights granted under this here license be granted fer the term o'
copyright on the program, an' be irrevocable provided the stated
conditions be met. This here license explicitly affirms yer unlimited
permission to run the unmodified program. The output from runnin' a
covered work be covered by this here license only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This here license acknowledges yer
rights o' fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 
  ye may make, run an' propagate covered works that there ye do not
convey, without conditions so long as yer license otherwise remains
in force. Ye may convey covered works to others fer the sole purpose
o' 'avin' them make modifications exclusively fer ye, or provide ye
with facilities fer runnin' them works, provided that there ye comply with
the terms o' this here license in conveyin' all arr, material fer which ye do
not control copyright. Them thus makin' or runnin' the covered works
fer ye must do so exclusively on yer behalf, under yer direction
an' control, on terms that there prohibit them from makin' any copies o'
yer copyrighted arr, material outside their relationship with ye.
 
  conveyin' under any other circumstances be permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensin' be not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
 
  3. Protectin' users' legal rights from anti-circumvention law.
 
  no covered work shall be deemed part o' an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfillin' obligations under article
11 o' the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996, or
similarrr laws prohibitin' or restrictin' circumvention o' such
measures.
 
  when ye convey a covered work, ye waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention o' technological measures to the extent such circumvention
be effected by exercisin' rights under this here license with respect to
the covered work, an' ye disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification o' the work as a means o' enforcing, against the work's
users, yer or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention o'
technological measures.
 
  4. Conveyin' verbatim copies.
 
  ye may convey verbatim copies o' the program's source code as ye
receive it, in any medium, provided that there ye conspicuously an'
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices statin' that there this here license an' any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices o' the absence o' any warranty; an' give all
recipients a copy o' this here license along with the program.
 
  ye may charge any price or no price fer each copy that there ye convey,
an' ye may offer support or warranty protection fer a fee.
 
  5. Conveyin' modified source versions.
 
  ye may convey a work based on the program, or the modifications to
produce it from the program, in the form o' source code under the
terms o' section 4, provided that there ye also meet all o' these conditions:

    a) the work must carry prominent notices statin' that there ye modified
    it, an' givin' a relevant date.
 
    b) the work must carry prominent notices statin' that there it be
    released under this here license an' any conditions added under section
    7. This here requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".
 
    c) ye must license the entire work, as a 'ole, under this here
    license to anyone who comes into possession o' a copy. This here
    license will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the 'ole o' the work, an' all its parts,
    regardless o' 'ow they be packaged. This here license gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if ye 'ave separately received it.
 
    d) if the work 'as interactive user interfaces, each must display
    appropriate legal notices; 'owever, if the program 'as interactive
    interfaces that there do not display appropriate legal notices, yer
    work need not make them do so.
 
  a compilation o' a covered work with other separate an' independent
works, which ain't by their nature extensions o' the covered work,
an' which ain't combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume o' a storage or distribution medium, be called an
"aggregate" if the compilation an' its resultin' copyright ain't
used to limit the access or legal rights o' the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion o' a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this here license to apply to the other
parts o' the aggregate.
 
  6. Conveyin' non-source forms.
 
  ye may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
o' sections 4 an' 5, provided that there ye also convey the
machine-readable correspondin' source under the terms o' this here license,
in one o' these ways:

    a) convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (includin' a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    correspondin' source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used fer software interchange.
 
    b) convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (includin' a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid fer at least three years an' valid fer as
    long as ye offer spare parts or customer support fer that there product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy o' the correspondin' source fer all the software in the
    product that there be covered by this here license, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used fer software interchange, fer a price no
    more than yer reasonable cost o' physically performin' this here
    conveyin' o' source, or (2) access to copy the
    correspondin' source from a network server at no charge.
 
    c) convey individual copies o' the object code with a copy o' the
    written offer to provide the correspondin' source. This here
    alternative be allowed only occasionally an' noncommercially, an'
    only if ye received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
 
    d) convey the object code by offerin' access from a designated
    place (gratis or fer a charge), an' offer equivalent access to the
    correspondin' source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge. Ye need not require recipients to copy the
    correspondin' source along with the object code. If the place to
    copy the object code be a network server, the correspondin' source
    may be on a different server (operated by ye or a third party)
    that there supports equivalent copyin' facilities, provided ye maintain
    clearrr directions next to the object code sayin' where to find the
    correspondin' source. Regardless o' what server 'osts the
    correspondin' source, ye remain obligated to ensure that there it be
    available fer as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 
    e) convey the object code usin' peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    ye inform other peers where the object code an' correspondin'
    source o' the work be bein' offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.
 
  a separable portion o' the object code, whose source code be excluded
from the correspondin' source as a system library, need not be
included in conveyin' the object code work.
 
  a "user product" be either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which be normally used fer personal, family,
or 'ousehold purposes, or (2) anythin' designed or sold fer incorporation
into a dwellin'. In determinin' whether a product be a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor o' coverage. Fer a particularrr
product received by a particularrr user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use o' that there class o' product, regardless o' the status
o' the particularrr user or o' the way in which the particularrr user
actually uses, or expects or be expected to use, the product. A product
be a consumer product regardless o' whether the product 'as substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode o' use o' the product.
 
  "installation information" fer a user product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
an' execute modified versions o' a covered work in that there user product from
a modified version o' its correspondin' source. The information must
suffice to ensure that there the continued functionin' o' the modified object
code be in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification been made.
 
  if ye convey an object code work under this here section in, or with, or
specifically fer use in, a user product, an' the conveyin' occurs as
part o' a transaction in which starboard o' possession an' use o' the
user product be transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or fer a
fixed term (regardless o' 'ow the transaction be characterized), the
correspondin' source conveyed under this here section must be accompanied
by the installation information. But this here requirement does not apply
if neither ye nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the user product (for example, the work 'as
been installed in rom).
 
  the requirement to provide installation information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
fer a work that there been modified or installed by the recipient, or fer
the user product in which it been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself arr, materially an'
adversely affects the operation o' the network or violates the rules an'
protocols fer communication across the network.
 
  correspondin' source conveyed, an' installation information provided,
in accord with this here section must be in a format that there be publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), an' must require no special password or key fer
unpacking, readin' or copyin'.
 
  7. Additional terms.
 
  "additional permissions" be terms that there supplement the terms o' this here
license by makin' exceptions from one or more o' its conditions.
 additional permissions that there be applicable to the entire program shall
be treated as though they was included in this here license, to the extent
that there they be valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part o' the program, that there part may be used separately
under them permissions, but the entire program remains governed by
this here license without regard to the additional permissions.
 
  when ye convey a copy o' a covered work, ye may at yer option
remove any additional permissions from that there copy, or from any part o'
it. (additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when ye modify the work.)  ye may place
additional permissions on arr, material, added by ye to a covered work,
fer which ye 'ave or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 
  notwithstandin' any other provision o' this here license, fer arr, material ye
add to a covered work, ye may (if authorized by the copyright 'olders o'
that there arr, material) supplement the terms o' this here license with terms:

    a) disclaimin' warranty or limitin' liability differently from the
    terms o' sections 15 an' 16 o' this here license; or

    b) requirin' preservation o' specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that there arr, material or in the appropriate legal
    notices displayed by works containin' it; or

    c) prohibitin' misrepresentation o' the origin o' that there arr, material, or
    requirin' that there modified versions o' such arr, material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) limitin' the use fer publicity purposes o' names o' licensors or
    authors o' the arr, material; or

    e) declinin' to grant rights under trademark law fer use o' some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) requirin' indemnification o' licensors an' authors o' that there
    arr, material by anyone who conveys the arr, material (or modified versions o'
    it) with contractual assumptions o' liability to the recipient, fer
    any liability that there these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    them licensors an' authors.
 
  all other non-permissive additional terms be considered "further
restrictions" within the meanin' o' section 10. If the program as ye
received it, or any part o' it, contains a notice statin' that there it be
governed by this here license along with a term that there be a further
restriction, ye may remove that there term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensin' or conveyin' under this here
license, ye may add to a covered work arr, material governed by the terms
o' that there license document, provided that there the further restriction does
not survive such relicensin' or conveyin'.
 
  if ye add terms to a covered work in accord with this here section, ye
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement o' the
additional terms that there apply to them files, or a notice indicatin'
where to find the applicable terms.
 
  additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form o' a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
 
  8. Termination.
 
  ye may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this here license. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it be void, an' will automatically terminate yer rights under
this here license (includin' any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph o' section 11).
 
  'owever, if ye avast all violation o' this here license, then yer
license from a particularrr copyright 'older be reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless an' until the copyright 'older explicitly an'
finally terminates yer license, an' (b) permanently, if the copyright
'older fails to notify ye o' the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 
  moreover, yer license from a particularrr copyright 'older be
reinstated permanently if the copyright 'older notifies ye o' the
violation by some reasonable means, this here be the first time ye 'ave
received notice o' violation o' this here license (for any work) from that there
copyright 'older, an' ye cure the violation prior to 30 days after
yer receipt o' the notice.
 
  termination o' yer rights under this here section does not terminate the
licenses o' parties who 'ave received copies or rights from ye under
this here license. If yer rights 'ave been terminated an' not permanently
reinstated, ye do not qualify to receive new licenses fer the same
arr, material under section 10.
 
  9. Acceptance not required fer 'avin' copies.
 
  ye ain't required to accept this here license in order to receive or
run a copy o' the program. Ancillary propagation o' a covered work
occurrin' solely as a consequence o' usin' peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. 'owever,
nothin' other than this here license grants ye permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if ye do
not accept this here license. Therefore, by modifyin' or propagatin' a
covered work, ye indicate yer acceptance o' this here license to do so.
 
  10. Automatic licensin' o' downstream recipients.
 
  each time ye convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify an'
propagate that there work, subject to this here license. Ye ain't responsible
fer enforcin' compliance by third parties with this here license.
 
  an "entity transaction" be a transaction transferrin' control o' an
organization, or substantially all assets o' one, or subdividin' an
organization, or mergin' organizations. If propagation o' a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that there
transaction who receives a copy o' the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest 'ad or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession o' the
correspondin' source o' the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor 'as it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 
  ye may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise o' the
rights granted or affirmed under this here license. Fer example, ye may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge fer exercise o'
rights granted under this here license, an' ye may not initiate litigation
(includin' a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) allegin' that there
any patent claim be infringed by making, using, selling, offerin' fer
sale, or importin' the program or any portion o' it.
 
  11. Patents.
 
  a "contributor" be a copyright 'older who authorizes use under this here
license o' the program or a work on which the program be based. The
work thus licensed be called the contributor's "contributor version".
 
  a contributor's "essential patent claims" be all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
'ereafter acquired, that there would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this here license, o' making, using, or sellin' its contributor version,
but do not include claims that there would be infringed only as a
consequence o' further modification o' the contributor version. Fer
purposes o' this here definition, "control" includes starboard to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements o'
this here license.
 
  each contributor grants ye a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer fer sale, import an' otherwise run, modify an'
propagate the contents o' its contributor version.
 
  in the followin' three paragraphs, a "patent license" be any express
agreement or commitment, 'owever denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue fer patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
 
  if ye convey a covered work, knowingly relyin' on a patent license,
an' the correspondin' source o' the work be not available fer anyone
to copy, free o' charge an' under the terms o' this here license, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then ye must either (1) cause the correspondin' source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yerself o' the benefit o' the
patent license fer this here particularrr work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements o' this here license, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "knowingly relying" means ye 'ave
actual knowledge that there, but fer the patent license, yer conveyin' the
covered work in a country, or yer recipient's use o' the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that there
country that there ye 'ave reason to believe be valid.
 
  if, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, ye convey, or propagate by procurin' conveyance o', a
covered work, an' grant a patent license to some o' the parties
receivin' the covered work authorizin' them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy o' the covered work, then the patent license
ye grant be automatically extended to all recipients o' the covered
work an' works based on it.
 
  a patent license be "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope o' its coverage, prohibits the exercise o', or be
conditioned on the non-exercise o' one or more o' the rights that there be
specifically granted under this here license. Ye may not convey a covered
work if ye be a party to an arrangement with a third party that there be
in the business o' distributin' software, under which ye make payment
to the third party based on the extent o' yer activity o' conveyin'
the work, an' under which the third party grants, to any o' the
parties who would receive the covered work from ye, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies o' the covered work
conveyed by ye (or copies made from them copies), or (b) primarily
fer an' in connection with specific products or compilations that there
contain the covered work, unless ye entered into that there arrangement,
or that there patent license been granted, prior to 28 march 2007.
 
  nothin' in this here license shall be construed as excludin' or limitin'
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that there may
otherwise be available to ye under applicable patent law.
 
  12. No surrender o' others' freedom.
 
  if conditions be imposed on ye (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that there contradict the conditions o' this here license, they do not
excuse ye from the conditions o' this here license. If ye cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously yer obligations under this here
license an' any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence ye may
not convey it at all. Fer example, if ye agree to terms that there obligate ye
to collect a royalty fer further conveyin' from them to whom ye convey
the program, the only way ye could satisfy both them terms an' this here
license would be to refrain entirely from conveyin' the program.
 
  13. Use with the gnu affero general public license.
 
  notwithstandin' any other provision o' this here license, ye 'ave
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 o' the gnu affero general public license into a single
combined work, an' to convey the resultin' work. The terms o' this here
license will continue to apply to the part which be the covered work,
but the special requirements o' the gnu affero general public license,
section 13, concernin' interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
 
  14. Revised versions o' this here license.
 
  the free software foundation may publish revised an'/or new versions o'
the gnu general public license from time to time. Such new versions will
be similarrr in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
 
  each version be given a distinguishin' version number. If the
program specifies that there a certain numbered version o' the gnu general
public license "or any later version" applies to it, ye 'ave the
option o' followin' the terms an' conditions either o' that there numbered
version or o' any later version published by the free software
foundation. If the program does not specify a version number o' the
gnu general public license, ye may choose any version e'er published
by the free software foundation.
 
  if the program specifies that there a proxy can decide which future
versions o' the gnu general public license can be used, that there proxy's
public statement o' acceptance o' a version permanently authorizes ye
to choose that there version fer the program.
 
  later license versions may give ye additional or different
permissions. 'owever, no additional obligations be imposed on any
author or copyright 'older as a result o' yer choosin' to follow a
later version.
 
  15. Disclaimer o' warranty.
 
  there be no warranty fer the program, to the extent permitted by

                     end o' terms an' conditions

            'ow to apply these terms to yer new programs

  if ye develop a new program, an' ye want it to be o' the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this here be to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute an' change under these terms.
 
  to do so, attach the followin' notices to the program. It be safest
to attach them to the start o' each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion o' warranty; an' each file should 'ave at least
the "copyright" line an' a pointer to where the full notice be found.
 
    <one line to give the program's name an' a brief idea o' what it does.>
    copyright (c) <year>  <name o' author>

    this here program be free software: ye can redistribute it an'/or modify
    it under the terms o' the gnu general public license as published by
    the free software foundation, either version 3 o' the license, or
    (at yer option) any later version.
 
    this here program be distributed in the 'ope that there it be useful,
    but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty o'
    merchantability or fitness fer a particularrr purpose. See the
    gnu general public license fer more details.
 
    ye should 'ave received a copy o' the gnu general public license
    along with this here program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 
also add information on 'ow to contact ye by electronic an' paper mail.
 
  if the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this here when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  copyright (c) <year>  <name o' author>
    this here program comes with absolutely no warranty; fer details type `show w'.
     this here be free software, an' ye be ye be welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' fer details.
 
the 'ypothetical commands `show w' an' `show c' should show the appropriate
parts o' the general public license. O' course, yer program's commands
might be different; fer a gui interface, ye would use an "about box".
 
  ye should also get yer employer (if ye work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" fer the program, if necessary.
 fer more information on this here, an' 'ow to apply an' follow the gnu gpl, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 
  the gnu general public license does not permit incorporatin' yer program
into proprietary programs. If yer program be a subroutine library, ye
may consider it more useful to permit linkin' proprietary applications with
the library. If this here be what ye want to do, use the gnu lesser general
public license instead o' this here license. But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.'tml>.
